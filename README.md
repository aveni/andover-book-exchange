# Andover Book Exchange

This is for students tired of forking out large amounts of money for textbooks on top of an already obscene tuition bill, only to sell them at the end of the year for a small fraction of the cost. Let's stop wasting time, money and paper and focus on reason why we are here: to learn. The Andover Book Exchange connects Phillips Academy students who need to buy and sell their books at affordable prices.
